# What is Project Bandit?
Project bandit is a simple discord bot and discord selfbot, written in node.js and python. It was discontinued because we didn't want to make a Discord Selfbot anymore and the bot's source was turned into Solace Bot. Bandit bot also had its own personal website which I didn't make ( credits to value )
